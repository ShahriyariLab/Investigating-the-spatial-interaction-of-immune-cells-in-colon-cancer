This folder contains file required for simulating the developement of Colon Cancer considering immune cell sources inside of it microenvironment.

Corresponding paper: "Investigating the spatial interaction of immune cells in colon cancer"

Code Authors: Navid Mohammad Mirzaei (https://github.com/nmirzaei) (https://sites.google.com/view/nmirzaei)

Executable file: Main.py

Requirements:

(1) FEniCS version : 2019.2.0.dev0

(2) pandas, scipy, numpy, FEniCS callable GMSH

NOTE1: All the packages in (2) will be installed by the code, if missing.

NOTE2: This code produces a folder called "displacement" in "Investigating-the-spatial-interaction-of-immune-cells-in-colon-cancer/Sensitivity/Cancer_and_CancerImmuneRatio_sensitivity" which is required for the executaion of the corresponding sensitivity code.
